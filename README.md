# Holberton School Curriculum: 0x00. Build a web app in JavaScript

## Project

1. [Build a web app in JavaScript](https://intranet.hbtn.io/projects/1691)

In this project, you will finalize the previous project [0x0B. Implement a design with bootstrap](https://intranet.hbtn.io/projects/1687) and make some parts dynamic with Javascript (JQuery exactly).

You will reuse final files of [0x0B. Implement a design with bootstrap](https://intranet.hbtn.io/projects/1687) and update them.

You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design/Bootstrap/Javascript knowledges that you learned previously.

You won‚Äôt have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have fully functional web pages that look the same as the designer file.

**Here the final result on both desktop and mobile versions:**

##### This webpage has been designed by Nicolas Philippot, UI/UX designer.

- [Prototype: Hompeage](https://www.figma.com/file/OBKqrpHdl4oFmYecMQIorA/Homepage-(Copy))
- [Prototype: Pricing](https://www.figma.com/file/IyFWRKuqs4cg9dQJWNlawq/Pricing-(Copy))
- [Prototype: Courses](https://www.figma.com/file/Oec2KeHHOTsDeP0qdUAjBf/Courses-(Copy))

### Requirements

* You have to use Bootstrap
* Your styles.css must be as small as you can - you must use as much as you can Bootstrap classes
* You have to use JQuery
* Your scripts.js must contain all your Javascript part
* Your Javascript must be executed only when the document is loaded

### Imports

#### For this project, you will need: fonts from Google, JQuery, Bootstrap CSS/JS

Check the [project page](https://intranet.hbtn.io/projects/1691) for imports.

# TASKS
## 0. Reuse and polish your Bootstrap integration
Copy files from [0x0B. Implement a design with bootstrap](https://intranet.hbtn.io/projects/1687):

* homepage.html -> 0-homepage.html
* pricing.html -> 0-pricing.html
* courses.html -> 0-courses.html
* styles.css and any files/folders needed (images, fonts‚Ä¶)

And finalize the design if it‚Äôs not done yet - the final result should be the same as these screens:

* [Homepage](https://www.figma.com/file/QYQqMYbdpAHL5xTclwJKSI/Homepage?node-id=0%3A1)
* [Pricing](https://www.figma.com/file/KLAI53jdYpfFNEy0O79ymB/Pricing)
* [Courses](https://www.figma.com/file/ivg3abH1HLmMayBgjGg1Qf/Courses)

Important notes with Figma:

if your computer doesn‚Äôt have missing fonts, you can find them here: source-sans-pro and Spin-Cycle-OT
some values are in float - feel free to round them
‚ÄúBe pixel perfect‚Äù - yes! but mainly make sure colors, size and position are correct. #C271FF is not purple.
For this task, please write an amazing README.md

Interactions note:

Web pages must switch to the tablet version when the screen width is 768px
Web pages must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 576px
button hover/active: opacity: 0.9

GitHub repository: holberton-smiling-school_v2
File: 0-homepage.html, 0-pricing.html, 0-courses.html, styles.css, README.md
````

## 1. Homepage - quotes
From 0-homepage.html, create 1-homepage.html.

Replace static quotes by dynamic loading:

* URL: https://smileschool-api.hbtn.info/quotes
* No static quotes should be present in the quotes section
* During the Ajax request, a loader should be present
* Carousel should work like before

Example of my loader:
`````
HTML:
<div class="loader"></div>
CSS:
.loader {
    border: 10px solid #f3f3f3;
    border-top: 10px solid #C271FF;
    border-radius: 50%;
    width: 80px;
    height: 80px;
    animation: spin 2s linear infinite;
    margin: auto;
}
@keyframes spin {
    0% { transform: rotate(0deg); }
    100% { transform: rotate(360deg); }
}
`````

* Carousel should work by sliding card by card (like GIF below) - this kind of carousel is not unique, make it generic to reuse it easily!
* Don‚Äôt forget the responsive part!
